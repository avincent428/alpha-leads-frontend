#[Click Here to view](https://alpha-leads-frontend.herokuapp.com/)
## Description
The main motivation behind this project was to solve the problem some small businesses may have in keeping track of leads and saving time. Currently, leads will call your phone number and the business owner has to manually keep track of whatever info they've been told. Then they have to write the information down somewhere. This project aims to solve that problem by creating software that automates this process and add an extra level of organization to the business.

## Features
- A form where a lead can input info about themselves and answer pre-qualifying questions.
- That info is then stored in a database to be used on the admin page
- The admin page divides these leads by potential clients, active clients, and archives. The business owner can look at potential clients and move them to their respective tab based on the outcome.

# Tech Stack
- Frontend: Reactjs and Node
- Backend: Express and MongoDB
# User Stories 
- As a user, I want to be able to find what I'm looking for on the website quickly and easily whether it be pictures, testimonials, contact forms, etc.
- As an admin, I want to create a form that asks qualifying questions to potential clients such as what colors do you want, the date and time of the event, what venue you're using, etc.
- As an admin, I want a clean homepage that will direct customers to the contact form after showing them what our business is all about.
- As an admin, I want to store the user's contact info so that I can retarget them later on.
